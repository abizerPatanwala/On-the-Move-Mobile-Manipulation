# On the Move Mobile Manipulation
The aim of this project is to pick up an object while the base of the mobile manipulator is moving towards the goal. It **improves task execution time by an average of 23%** as compared to the case when th base stops for arm manipulation. This is ahieved by selecting a pick pose by optimizing a novel cost function and coordinating timely execution of arm and base motion while the base heads towards the goal. The system is tested in Gazebo wih a UR5e arm attached to a mobile base, where the robot picks a cuboid shape object from a table.
